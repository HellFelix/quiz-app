# Quiz Taking Tool
This is an app I built that can be used to take a quizlet quiz by providing a url.

## Usage
### Prerequisites
This is an app that runs with [tauri](https://tauri.app/) using npm. Provided you have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed and you have [set up your Rust environment locally](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started), you're good to go!

### Setup
To run the app, clone this repository  
```
git clone git@github.com:HellFelix/quizlet-clone.git
```
navigate to the directory 
```
cd quizlet-clone
```
install node modules
```
npm install
```
then run the app
```
npm run tauri dev
```

### Navigate the app

Upon opening the app, you'll be greeted by an input space and a "Take Quiz" button. You can input a link to a quizlet study set and then just click the button to take the quiz!
